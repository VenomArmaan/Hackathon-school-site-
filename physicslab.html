            <p>Physics is the study of matterâ€”its composition, properties, and interactions. It plays a fundamental role in<br/>
                science, closely linked to fields like Chemistry, Biology, and Geology. However, theoretical knowledge alone is<br/>
                incomplete without practical application. At our school, the Physics lab is fully equipped with modern scientific<br/>
                instruments that meet CBSE and NCERT standards. Safety is a top priority, with strict precautions in place and<br/>
                first aid readily available to handle any incidents. The lab is supervised by a highly experienced instructor who<br/>
                has been a part of the institution for several years. Students get hands-on experience with tools, apparatus, and <br/>
                various instruments, allowing them to observe, analyze, and understand concepts more effectively. This practical<br/>
                approach enhances learning, making Physics an exciting and interactive subject. </p>
