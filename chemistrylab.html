            <p>Chemistry is the study of matterâ€”its composition, properties, and interactions. It plays a fundamental role in<br/>
                science, closely linked to fields like Physics, Biology, and Geology. However, theoretical knowledge alone is<br/>
                incomplete without practical application. At our school, the Chemistry lab is fully equipped with modern scientific<br/>
                instruments that meet CBSE and NCERT standards. Safety is a top priority, with strict precautions in place and<br/>
                 first aid readily available to handle any incidents. The lab is supervised by a highly experienced instructor who<br/>
                  has been a part of the institution for several years. Students get hands-on experience with salts, acids, and <br/>
                  various chemical reactions, allowing them to observe, analyze, and understand concepts more effectively. This practical<br/>
                   approach enhances learning, making Chemistry an exciting and interactive subject. </p>

                Our chemistry teacher, Ashok Sir, is a dedicated and inspiring educator. With a deep<br/>
                understanding of the subject, he makes even complex topics easy to grasp. His teaching<br/>
                style is clear, engaging, and practical, often using real-life examples to explain <br/>
                chemical concepts. Ashok Sir is patient and always ready to help students, encouraging <br/>
                questions and critical thinking. His passion for chemistry is evident and motivates us to<br/>
                learn with interest. Beyond academics, he is kind, approachable, and disciplined, creating<br/>
                a positive classroom environment. We are grateful for his guidance and the knowledge he <br/>
                shares with us every day.
